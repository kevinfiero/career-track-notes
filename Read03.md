* Clean Code - [Link](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780132350884/samplepages/9780132350884.pdf)
    * Code will need to be written by humans for the foreseeable future as creativity and vague requirements will make it difficult to be automated.
    * Bad code written will eventually become unmanageable and too hard to modify or maintain. Rushing can lead to short-term wins but ultimately may put a company out of business in the long run.
    * The prime culprit of bad code is rushing through it for one reason or another and vowing to clean it up later. However, this seldom happens as there is always more to get done.
    * Increasing productivity and pressure by management leads to a boiling point of developers demanding to slow down or management hiring more staff with little returns.
    * It is important to stand up to managers who do not understand the design of the code. Timelines need to slow down or something has got to give so that the development process can output clean code.
    * Programmers need "code-sense" to know what clean and bad code looks like and how to write clean code.
    * Reduce dependencies, making the code easy to read, optimizing speed, naming conventions, memory leaks, etc. are all principles of making the code clean.
    * Bad code tries to do too much in a single module.
    * According to Ron Jeffries avoiding duplication and repetitive logic is a good aspect to strive toward as it eliminates other issues. Another factor is to be expressive with variables, methods, etc. so the code is readable.
    * There are many schools of thought about writing clean code. None of these are objectively right or wrong but developers prescribe to one or another as a sort of guiding star.
    * Boy Scout Rule - make things cleaner than when you found it. This could be changing a small line of code and does not need to be a massive refactoring overhaul.
* Class Syntax [Link](https://javascript.info/class) + MDN - Classes [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
    * I am familiar with classes from Java and Python in prior studies.
    * Classes are convenient to use when many objects need to be created that have the same structure, methods, etc. but consist of different values.
    * Use of the <code>this</code> syntax to assign values to an instance of an object.
    * Getters and methods are used to compute or retrieve information about the object.
    * A class can extend another class using the extends keyword.
