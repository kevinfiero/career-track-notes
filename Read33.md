* Composition vs. Inheritance [Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
  * Composition seems like it is just a div embedded in a parent div. I think we have been doing this already so I don't understand the difference between inheritance.
* Use Reducer - Hooks API Reference [Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
  * useReduce seems to be interchangeable with useState but it used in a more specific scenario. The documentation mentions when knowing the previous state such as page numbers would be ideal.
* Redux - Three Principles [Link](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles)
  * Single source of truth - stored in a single object tree.
  * State is read-only - actions are emitted so state can't be changed directly.
  * Changes are made with pure functions - take the previous state and a function to output a new state.
* Redux - Core Concepts [Link](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)
  * Reducers are what is used to change the state.
