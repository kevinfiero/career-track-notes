The following is from the preparation work for Career Track. I have read each of the associated articles, completed the TDD challenges, and wrote a blurb.

* Objects - [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer)
    * Basics - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/object-literal/basics)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to properly initialize objects with literals and functions.
    * Computed Properties [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/object-literal/computed-properties)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to create a dynamic key using various concepts such as expressions, functions, and object literals.
* Classes - [Inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) + [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
    * Creation - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/class/creation)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to create classes using various concepts such as using the constructor and defining methods.
    * Statics - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/class/static)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to use the static keyword in front of methods.
    * Extends - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/class/extends)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to use the extend keyword. This keywords allows classes to inherit from another class. This also works over multiple levels.
* Destructuring - [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
    * Array Destructuring - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/array)
        * This series of tests illustrates how to use array destructuring. Primarily, the tests passed when adding **[]** or **,** to the correct location in the code.
    * String Destructuring - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/string) 
        * This series of tests is similar to array destructuring but for strings instead. Again, adding **[]** or **,** to the correct location in the code.
    * Object Destructuring - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/object)
        * This series of tests is similar to the array destructuring but with objects. I did not understand what the last test was asking for to *destructure from builtins*.
    * Destructuring with Defaults - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/defaults)
        * This series of tests uses defaults to assign values when there is not corresponding value in the input object or array. Some syntax needed to be cleaned up using brackets, commas, and braces.
    * Destructuring Function Parameters - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/parameters)
        * This series of tests uses destructuring to pass parameters into functions.
    * Destructuring with Alias - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/destructuring/rename)
        * This series of tests uses destructuring and default values to assign to aliases using the **propertyName: newName** syntax.
* Rest - [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
    * Rest as a Parameter - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/rest/as-parameter)
        * This series of tests illustrates the different properties rest has when being used as a function parameter. This includes having it as the last argument.
    * Rest while Destructuring - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/rest/with-destructuring)
        * This series of tests combines destructuring with rest. The last two actually use spread.
* Spread - [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
    * Array Spread - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/spread/with-arrays)
        * Blurb
* Function Defaults - [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)
    * Function Defaults - [Link](https://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/default-parameters/basics)
        * Blurb
