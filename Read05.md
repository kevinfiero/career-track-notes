* Postgres Insert - [Link](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-insert/)
    * Inserting is used to put in a row of values into a table by specifying the corresponding data table fields. This also gives the option to return the row that was inserted with the RETURNING statement.
* Postgres Select - [Link](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select/)
    * The SELECT statement allows for a return of the requested data. There are several operators when using SELECT statements that aid in this data retrieval. This includes ORDER BY, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, INNER JOIN, etc. that will allow different combinations or subsets of a table or multiple tables.
* Postgres Update - [Link](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-update/)
    * The UPDATE statements allows for an update of the specified row of data. By specifying the subset of data using a WHERE clause you can overwrite table rows with specified values.

    * The DELETE statement allows for the removal of specified rows or tables.
